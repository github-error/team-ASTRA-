introduction : 
With climate change becoming a growing threat, the world is in need of  smart tech-based solutions. Empowering ecosystem is an innovative software platform that uses AI to monitor the environment and optimize energy use, helping tackle sustainability challenges. This document explains empowering ecosystem vision, features, and how it can contribute to a greener future.

Problem: create a software solution that addresses a key environmental or  sustainability challenge. Focus on the area like AI driven environmental monitoring.


Solution: we use a camera detection method from which we analyse if the plant is in good health or its diseased. It shows about the details of the flower, where its mostly found and the climatic weather which is necessary for it to grow. It guides the users with how to keep the flower healthy and if its diseased then it show an alert that the plant is defective and how we can cure the plant and about its precautions.
